Description:
The project can be run in two ways and for the both ways,the code is included in the file.All the work is in src>Components>speed.
1)The first way to run is as it is deployed. The data for speed is generated randomly with random function.
2)In second way,the data is fetched from backend(API) where again random values are returned and then rendered on the UI.
*****Only Basic Css is used.



Instructions:
There are separate instructions for different type run:
1)For first way,you can directly go to "https://abusalehkhan12.github.io/TGS-intern/" as it is deployed on github itself or you can download the repository and run "npm start" on your terminal.
2)*****For second way,go to src>Components>speed. Edit speed file and remove all the comments and bring it to file.Comment all the sections where "Comment It" or "Comment the function" is mentioned. Run the "tgs.py" in flask environment at "localhost:5000".Now the run the command "npm start" in react src file. Or you can give your own API with just little changes in the code.
